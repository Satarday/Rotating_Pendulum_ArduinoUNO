# Rotating_Pendulum_ArduinoUNO
In this repository you can find my version of the implementation of a system that controls the stabilization of a rotary-type reverse pendulum. This program was written for use on ArduinoUno. The project also uses CNC Shield V3, DRV8825, Nema 17 motor and Omron encoder (2000 divisions per revolution). Motor control is implemented using the GyverStepper library. Receiving data from the encoder is implemented through the EncButton library.
